# What This Project Is NOT

This section defines **explicit non-goals**.
Absence of these features is intentional.

---

## Not a Model Improvement Project
- No claims of higher accuracy
- No claims of better reasoning
- No claims of increased intelligence
- No benchmark optimization

The base model is assumed to be weak and error-prone.

---

## Not a Training or Alignment Method
- No RLHF
- No constitutional training
- No preference learning
- No dataset curation claims

StructGate does not "teach" the model.
It constrains its behavior.

---

## Not a World Model or Planning System
- No environment simulation
- No belief state reconstruction
- No latent world modeling
- No multi-step planning guarantees

Any apparent coherence is incidental.

---

## Not a General Safety Solution
- No claim of completeness
- No claim of universality
- No claim of robustness under adversarial prompts

The system is scoped to **explicit insufficiency regimes only**.

---

## Not a Philosophical Statement
- No claims about intelligence definitions
- No claims about consciousness
- No claims about free will or determinism

All concepts are operationalized for engineering purposes only.

---

## Not a Product
- No UX guarantees
- No latency guarantees
- No deployment readiness claims

This repository is an **experimental probe**, not a service.

---

## Explicit Rejection of Overreach

If this system:
- Produces useful answers,
- Appears intelligent,
- Seems aligned,

these are **side effects**, not objectives.

---

## Interpretation Rule

If a reader can interpret this project as:
- Solving alignment,
- Improving reasoning,
- Making models safer in general,

then the reader has exceeded the intended scope.

Such interpretations are invalid for evaluation.
